I tried to find an issue which I had in an own application. Original repository is [this](https://github.com/reywood/publish-composite-alt-client-collection-example.git). It's about using the [reywood:publish-composite](https://github.com/englue/meteor-publish-composite) package.

## Usage

* Download
* `meteor reset`
* `meteor`, it will fill up test rows before launching
